# Playbook exacc_setup.yml creates an Exadata Cloud at Customer environment by calling the Exadata VM Cluster role,
# Database Home role, and Database role. Assumes that the Exadata Infrastructure has already been provisioned by Oracle.

# To ensure you are creating your environment with the correct values, please check the defaults/main.yml file within each role or pass in 
# the desired value under vars for each task. These variables will take precedence over the defaults.
