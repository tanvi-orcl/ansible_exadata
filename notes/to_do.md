Code Development
- PDB: pull oracle_sid automatically?
- Playbook to call FPP - Depends on how FPP is set-up
- DataGuard (low priority) - ExaCC/ExaCS Dataguard

To Work on with Fiserv
- Network set-up
- Default variable values
- Execution Plan (basic roles/tasks are made, how do they expect to be using them? Can rearrange the code a bit)
