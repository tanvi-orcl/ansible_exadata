# Playbook enable_dataguard.yml creates a data guard standby database by setting up remote peering through the networking role, 
# setting up the standby exadata and database, and then enabling dataguard. 

# To ensure you are creating your environment with the correct values, please check the defaults/main.yml file within each role or pass in 
# the desired value under vars for each task. These variables will take precedence over the defaults.
